# ECE143 Project Proposal

    Hao Zhao, Ian Pegg, Sepehr Foroughi, Harshita Krishna - Group 17

## Problem

Marketing campaigns are a widely used approach to business growth. To maximize the impact of a marketing campaign, a 
business can target customers directly with phone calls. To execute such a campaign successfully, the business must 
know who to target, and exactly how to target them.

## Data

The dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing gives us a snapshot of this problem. This 
contains demographic, marketing contact, and outcome information for 41,188 customers of a Portuguese banking 
institution looking to sell a subscription to an investment product.

## Proposed Solution

Our goal in the analysis of this dataset will be to predict which customers will eventually subscribe to the bank's 
product. This analysis would allow the bank to decide *who* to target and *how* to target them. To attempt to address
this issue, we will answer the following questions:

1. Are people of higher income more likely to subscribe?
2. Is there a particular day of the week when people are more receptive to marketing calls?
3. Is there a time of day when people are more receptive to marketing calls?
4. Are men or women more likely to subscribe?
5. What is the most important collection of features predictive of a successful outcome?

## Project Plan

1. Explore and clean the data - 1 week - Hao
2. Extract information based on the research questions - 2 weeks - Sepehr & Ian
3. Data visualization - 2 week - Harshita
